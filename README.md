CS 449 Prototype Demos

This course was an exercise in learning how to construct a prototype from a user experience standpoint.
By abstracting away the implementation, it is important to ensure that users have a good experience with the application: this isn't necessarily the same as having a good user interface. 

Our application was designed to improve the user review experience for businesses.

There are many steps to creating a prototype, roughly summarized as follows:
1. Create a plan and hypothesis
2. Conduct an exploratory user study
3. Create a paper prototype & test it
4. Refine based on test user feedback
5. Create a high-level prototype with software (in our case, we used Adobe XD)

Proof-of-concept scans soon to come, but please enjoy our final report on the project.
